resists.org
===========

The resists.org domain provides a consistent namespace for regional Ingress Resistance groups.  For consistency in the US and Canada, we mirror the Craigslist subdomain structure.  (ie, sfbay.resists.org, lasvegas.resists.org, easternshore.resists.org)

We do not actually host webpages for regional groups.  Instead, we will set up a CNAME from your region's subdomain to point at your own domain.  If you do not have a website yet, we recommend hosting one on Github Pages.  You can look at [the sfbay.resists.org](https://github.com/balshor/sfbay.resists.org) project for an example.

To request a CNAME, please file an issue under this project with a link to your domain.  We may need additional verification (eg, admission to your community, comm verification, and/or establishing a chain of trusted agents who can vouch for you) before accepting your request.
